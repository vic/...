== About

This is the home for vic's dot-files managed by freshshell.


== Installation

If you are vic or if you just want to clone all of vic's 
environment do:

```shell
curl -sL raw.github.com/vic/.../master/install.sh | bash -s
```

== Using your own repo.

If you already have a github repository for your dot-files
and would like to store your freshshell configuration on it,
just give your github repo and location of freshrc to *install.sh* 

```shell
curl -sL raw.github.com/vic/.../master/install.sh | bash -s you/repo config/freshrc
```
